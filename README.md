<h3 align="center">ABOUT THE REPOSITORY üìñ</h3>

<p align="justify">
This repository contains the design of a login screen for users of the Alligator website. The screen is responsive and was built using HTML and CSS, as this project is to demonstrate my skills with these two markup languages.

<h3 align="center">WHAT IS THIS PROJECT CALLED "Alligator"?" üêä </h3>

<p align="justify">
Alligator is the name given to a set of fictional, personal projects. The repositories that are linked to Alligator are exclusively for creating a hypothetical situation where I develop a solution and put my front-end, back-end and mobile knowledge into practice.
